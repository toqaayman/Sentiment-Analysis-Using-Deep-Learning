# Sentiment Analysis Using RNN, LSTM, and Attention

## Overview
This project employs advanced deep learning techniques, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, and Attention mechanisms, to analyze and predict sentiment from textual data.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project consists of textual data requiring sentiment analysis. The data is preprocessed to convert text into a suitable format for training deep learning models.

## Features
- Utilizes RNNs for handling sequential data, enhanced with LSTMs to capture long-term dependencies.
- Incorporates Attention mechanisms to improve model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence for better sentiment prediction.

## Prerequisites
Install the following Python libraries to run the project:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras
```
## Setup
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies mentioned above.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model.
## Model Training and Evaluation
The model architecture includes RNN layers, enhanced with LSTM cells and an Attention layer for optimal performance.
Evaluates using accuracy and loss metrics to determine model effectiveness in classifying sentiments.
## Results
The model demonstrates robust capability in sentiment classification, backed by detailed performance metrics and visualizations of Attention weights.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. If you have suggestions for improving the model or expanding the dataset, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
